  - Hey, how do you do?
  - Yeah, I'm fine and what about you? [P]

  - Hey man, I know it might sound like a weird request but...
  - If you ever find a teddy bear out here, could you pass it on to me?
  - Aren't you a bit old to be playing with that? [P]
  - Hey, listen. It's my daughter's favorite toy, she literally can't survive without
    it.

    key which looks kind of important
